If you'd like to see this in action, I demonstrated it on [Claire Vo's "How I AI" podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD4ktSkNCw4).

## üóÇÔ∏è Files in this Repository

*   **`create-prd.mdc`**: Guides the AI in generating a Product Requirement Document for your feature.
*   **`generate-tasks-from-prd.mdc`**: Takes a PRD markdown file as input and helps the AI break it down into a detailed, step-by-step implementation task list.
*   **`process-task-list.mdc`**: Instructs the AI on how to process the generated task list, tackling one task at a time and waiting for your approval before proceeding. (This file also contains logic for the AI to mark tasks as complete).

## üåü Benefits

*   **Structured Development:** Enforces a clear process from idea to code.
*   **Step-by-Step Verification:** Allows you to review and approve AI-generated code at each small step, ensuring quality and control.
*   **Manages Complexity:** Breaks down large features into smaller, digestible tasks for the AI, reducing the chance of it getting lost or generating overly complex, incorrect code.
*   **Improved Reliability:** Offers a more dependable approach to leveraging AI for significant development work compared to single, large prompts.
*   **Clear Progress Tracking:** Provides a visual representation of completed tasks, making it easy to see how much has been done and what's next.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get these `.mdc` files into your project or a central location where Cursor can access them.
2.  **Follow the Workflow:** Systematically use the `.mdc` files in Cursor's Agent chat as described in the 5-step workflow above.
3.  **Adapt and Iterate:**
    *   Feel free to modify the prompts within the `.mdc` files to better suit your specific needs or coding style.
    *   If the AI struggles with a task, try rephrasing your initial feature description or breaking down tasks even further.

## üí° Tips for Success

*   **Be Specific:** The more context and clear instructions you provide (both in your initial feature description and any clarifications), the better the AI's output will be.
*   **MAX Mode for PRDs:** As mentioned, using MAX mode in Cursor for PRD creation (`create-prd.mdc`) can yield more thorough and higher-quality results if your budget supports it.
*   **Correct File Tagging:** Always ensure you're accurately tagging the PRD filename (e.g., `@MyFeature-PRD.md`) when generating tasks.
*   **Patience and Iteration:** AI is a powerful tool, but it's not magic. Be prepared to guide, correct, and iterate. This workflow is designed to make that iteration process smoother.
